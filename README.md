This is a template for a Masters thesis in microelectronics at UiB.
The original template was created by Tea Bodova (Added to by Ilya Korneev).

This template creates a starting setup you can clone and modify to your liking.
The template shows examples of chapter, figure, table, and code listing setups.
Please feel free to change the setting to your liking.
I encourage you to play around.

To use this project, either install LaTeX from https://www.tug.org/texlive/windows.html and use VS Code as an editor; this works well!
Or you can add these files to an Oerleaf project.
