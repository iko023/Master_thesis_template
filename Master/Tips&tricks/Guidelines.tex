MSc thesis guidelines (LaTeX-based) 

It is possible I forgot to include some packages… so Google.

Some writing rules: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Avoid using should/would/could 
	\item Choose one type of headings and stick to it (https://www.scribbr.com/academic-writing/capitalization-titles-headings/) 
	\item Choose one style of writing lists and stick to it (full stop/comma/nothing after each item )
	\item Choose one style of writing author names in bibliography and stick to it (Widlar, Bob vs Widlar, B.) 
	\item Choose your terminology for your thesis and stick to it (e.g., if you refer to a trace on a PCB as trace, do not use wire/line/cable as a synonym) 
	\item Check if you use your terminology correctly (Do you really describe demux? Or is it decoder? Is it noise on the measured signal? Or is it distortion?)  
\end{itemize}

Some styling rules: 
\begin{itemize}
	 \item Keep one sentence per LaTex line - the .tex will looks cleaner
      \item Table caption above (\usepackage{float}  \floatstyle{plaintop} \restylefloat{table} in preamble) 
	 \item Figure caption below (set as default by latex) 
	 \item Always have full stop after the caption 
	 \item All unoriginal figures need reference 
	 \item Figures need clear caption 
	 \item Do not wrap text around figures 
	 \item All figures, tables, equations should have a reference in main text
	 \item All equations must have numbering  
	 \item Space between paragraphs  
	 \item Chapter always starts on the odd page, on the right page ( \documentclass[12pt, a4paper, twoside, openright]{book} ). It doesn’t fix the content before chapters!!!  
	 \item Space between value and unit. Best to use  unbreakable space (~) like this 30~s.
	 \item Space between text and parentheses
	 \item Use \times in math mode, also in text 
	 \item \usepackage{siunitx} $\SI{30}{\second}$  
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Bibliography}

\nocite{*} %prints all references 

If you use \cite in captions and you want to have references in Bib in order of appearance, use \usepackage{notoccite}  

BibTex entry types explained here https://www.andy-roberts.net/res/writing/latex/bibentries.pdf 

How to add a website to a bibtex file: use the @misc annotation, the entry should look like this: 

@misc{web-page-citekey, 

title = {{Title of th webpage}}, 

year = {2018}, 

author = {{Name of author of the webpage}}, 

month = {5}, 

publisher = {company/person that owns the website}, 

url = {http::/www.webside.com/}, 

urldate = {2020-05-16} 

} 

Others:
\begin{itemize}
	\item https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/glossaries    use \usepackage{glossary-mcols} if you want the acronyms in columns  
	\item \pagenumbering{roman} before Abstract, Acknowledgements, Table of Contents, List of Figures, List of Tables \pagenumbering{arabic} main chapters 
	\item Fancy chapter titles \usepackage{titlesec} 
	\item https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eWx8phUQISXhc5TsaiAi6_PavH1HyyRRmrymQ8VabxQ/edit#slide=id.ge260ecbfc3_0_0

  		 \cleardoublepage{}\phantomsection\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Bibliography} 

\bibliography{final} %this is the .bib file  

\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran} % download the IEEEtran .bst file here 

 

Figures: 

To have a pretty figure list when calling \listoffigures 

Use this snippet in the text where you want the figure to be (observe that the \caption has two blocks one for the \listoffigures and one for the figure itself). 

\begin{figure} 

\centering 

\includegraphics{} 

\caption[Caption in the list]{Caption under the figure} 

\label{fig:my_label} 

\end{figure}
